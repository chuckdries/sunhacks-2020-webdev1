# Web Development Up and Running

In this talk, I go over creating a working web application from scratch with node and express. In the first hour, we get an anonymous message board. In the next two hours, we add a database to store the messages, and we add a user registration and login system to keep track of who sent the messages.

The first hour or so is basics and the initial message board, then in the remaining 2 hours we go over databases and implement a user authentication system.

The 'main' branch is the result of the first hour of coding. The 'databases' branch has the code to look up the messages from a database instead of an array. Check out the 'user-authentication' branch for the login system we finished at the end.
